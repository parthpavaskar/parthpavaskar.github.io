      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research primarily focuses on the study of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. Plasma turbulence is a highly complex system which is dynamically governed by magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), and is a fundamental component in broader astrophysical research. It offers insights into phenomena such as cosmic-ray physics, star formation, and more. 

        I investigate plasma turbulence through a combination of theory, state-of-the-art fluid (MHD) and kinetic (PIC) simulations, and analysis of observational data to try and uncover these secrets. I'm also interested in topics such as cosmic-ray acceleration and transport in the ISM.
